# Installing MInference for running evaluation

Please follow the instructions in the [MInference](https://github.com/microsoft/MInference) repository to install the package. You should then be able to run the code in `eval/` from the top level of this repository.

Please note that we have modified the package a bit to add support for chunked patching, and to support Locret. 
Therefore, you should apply the above instructions to install *this* subdirectory, not the main MInference repository.
